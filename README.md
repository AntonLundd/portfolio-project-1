## Unfixed Bugs

- I am having trouble with the responsiveness of my image. Hopefully in the future i can solve this bug.
- A bug i did not have time to squash is the light blue background as well as the navigation bar looks weird on really small phone screens.

## Validator Testing

HTML validator (w3c markup service) showed no errors.

CSS validator (Jigsaw) showed no errors.
